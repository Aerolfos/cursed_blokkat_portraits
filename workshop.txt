If you thought the vintage portraits were not cursed enough already, this mod is for you!

Replaces the vintage selection of blokkat portraits with different art. Thanks to Elowiny for supplying the Blokkat images used.

Works with 3.9, and probably beyond, as long as Gigastructures keeps the same file structure for portraits.
